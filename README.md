## Description
Write a Pig Latin translator or should we say an "igPay atinLay anslatorTray"? Read all instructions carefully before beginning.

How Pig Latin Works
First, here are the rules of Pig Latin:

For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.

For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".

If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!

For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant.
