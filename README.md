## Description
A Pig Latin translator or should we say an "igPay atinLay anslatorTray"? Enter a word or sentence and the program will return it translated to pig latin.

This program should pass the following specs:
1. The program does nothing to non-alphabetical characters, since they do not contain consonants or vowels.
* input: 3 output: 3

2. The program adds "ay" to single-letter words beginning with a vowel.
* input: i output: iay

3. For words beginning with a vowel, add "ay" to the end.
* input: its  output: itsay

4. For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".
* input: say output: aysay

5. If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!
* input: queen output: eenquay

6. For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant.
* input: yellow output: ellowyay
